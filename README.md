A dark (black-green) gtk+ theme for linux.

I tried creating a gtk+ theme for linux for the first time.
It is available in [Pling](https://www.pling.com/p/1440685/).
If you wanna give it a try, clone the repository to your system or download it through [Pling](https://www.pling.com/p/1440685/), extract the files in your theme folder in linux system and enjoy.
